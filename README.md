# CS-XAML_-IT-230-

  These files were supplied by SNHU as part of an assignment to debug. For the console app, I debugged the program and documented the experience. For the WPF application which required a working GUI, I coded the section that
manages the GUI logic.

**What I would try to do differently**

  I would work more on design from the beginning of the assignment. When receiving a zip file with a project someone else created, I think it would be good practice to read documenation on the program or if that doesn't exist,
  read through the code and diagram the design on paper. This would help me understand the goal of the program and the strategy it uses. This would also help convey the style of the program such as naming convention which can be useful.

  **What I did well**
  
   All code I added is efficient and very readable. I take pride in writing code that looks nice to my eye in hopes it will be easier to read for fellow programmers. 
   I leave concise comments that usually describe a section of code instead of leaving comments on many lines; this gives a descriptor for the code block as well as keeping it more readable.
